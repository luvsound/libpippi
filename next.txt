Core:
    Add compile-time option for static tables...
    port more wavetables & windows
    Probably all non-factory types should have an lp prefix

Microsound:
    GrainProvider first pass
        sources: buffer, process callback
    Buffer stack routines?
    Waveset segmentation

FX:
    port butterworth lowpass from sndkit?
        might as well give JOS another shot first, too...
    port Will's SVFs from pippi

Scheduler:
    Add rendering_stack_head
    event_t should support some internal ugen abstraction (lpugen_t?)
    ugen abstraction should support lifecycle interfaces for:
        - libpippi ugens (easy)
        - soundpipe ugens (probably straightforward)
    ugens should be composable into arbitary graphs, ideally via an embedded scripting language as per previous discussions with PB!
    ugen graphs should allow injection of contexts to support external control (like MIDI or OSC or whatever)

    what does an instrument script look like in libpippi?
        - offline rendering vs realtime ugen graphs
