Core:
    Add compile-time option for static tables...
    Maybe split core implementation up into core.*.c files?
        Not to be modular, just to organize the sources a bit...

Microsound:
    GrainProvider first pass
        sources: buffer, process callback
    Buffer stack routines?
    Waveset segmentation

MIR:
    Refactor yin:
        single-sample provider
        optional default prefill value
        expose tolerance?
