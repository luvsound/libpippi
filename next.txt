Core:
    Add compile-time option for static tables...
    Maybe split core implementation up into core.*.c files?
        Not to be modular, just to organize the sources a bit...

MIR:
    Port Coyote onset routines from SuperCollider
    Is there a standalone fast yin implementation I can wrap? (Or implement from a paper?)
