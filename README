This is in development!

Running `make` will build these example programs:

- `examples/pulsar.c`
- `examples/sineosc.c`
- `examples/memory_pool.c`

...and run them, depositing test renders into the 
`renders` directory. 

Running `make wavetables` will generate static 
wavetable sources in the `generated` directory.
